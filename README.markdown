## Content

The file named `CMakeLists.txt` contains the full build description
for Couchbase. It should be copied to the top of your source directory
(this happens automatically when you are using repo).

The `cmake` directory contains macros used by cmake to configure a
build of Couchbase.

`Makefile` is a convenience file that repo will put in the root of
your source directory. It invokes `cmake` with a specific set of
options. "All" flavors of make should be able to parse this makefile,
and its defaults are set to match building on Microsoft Windows.

`GNUmakefile` is another convenience file that repo will put in the
root of your source directory. GNU make will favor this file over
`Makefile` and this file just overrides the defaults specified in
`Makefile`.

## How to build

Couchbase utilizes [CMake][cmake_link] in order to provide build
support for a wide range of platforms. CMake isn't a build system
like GNU Autotools, but a tool that generates build information for
external systems like: Visual Studio projects, XCode projects and
Makefiles to name a few. Their good support for Microsoft Windows and
Makefiles is the primary reason why we decided to move away from GNU
Autotools. CMake isn't a magic pill that solves all our problems; it
comes with its own list of challenges.

It is recommended to perform "out of source builds", which means that
the build artifacts is stored _outside_ the source directory.

### Simple build

If you just want to build Couchbase and without any special
configuration, you may use the Makefile we've supplied for your
convenience:

    trond@ok > mkdir source
    trond@ok > cd source
    trond@ok source> repo init -u git://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m branch-master.xml
    trond@ok source> repo sync
    trond@ok source> make

This would install the build software in a subdirectory named
`install`. To change this you may run:

    trond@ok source> make PREFIX=/opt/couchbase

### Customize your builds

CMake offers a wide range of customizations, and this chapter won't
try to cover all of them. There is plenty of documentation available
on the [webpage](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html).

There is no point of trying to keep a list of all tunables in this
document. To find the tunables you have two options: look in
`cmake/Modules/*.cmake` or you may look in the cache file generated
during a normal build (see `build/CMakeCache.txt`)

There are two ways to customize your own builds. You can do it all by
yourself by invoking cmake yourself:

    trond@ok > mkdir source
    trond@ok > mkdir build
    trond@ok > cd source
    trond@ok source> repo init -u git://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m branch-master.xml
    trond@ok source> repo sync
    trond@ok source> cd ../build
    trond@ok build> cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/couchbase -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D DTRACE_FOUND:BOOL=True -D DTRACE:FILEPATH=/usr/sbin/dtrace CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/r14b04;/opt/couchbase"
    trond@ok build> gmake all install

Or pass extra options to the convenience Makefile provided:

    trond@ok > mkdir source
    trond@ok > mkdir build
    trond@ok > cd source
    trond@ok source> repo init -u git://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m branch-master.xml
    trond@ok source> repo sync
    trond@ok source> make PREFIX=/opt/couchbase CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/r14b04;/opt/couchbase" EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS='-D DTRACE_FOUND:BOOL=True -D DTRACE:FILEPATH=/usr/sbin/dtrace'

Use `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to specify a "list" of directories to search
for tools/libraries if they are stored in "non-standard"
locations. Ex:

    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/r14b04;/opt/couchbase;/opt/local"

## Microsoft Windows 2008R2

The following steps is needed to build Couchbase on Microsoft Windows 2008R2

* Install OS, activate and run Windows Update and install all updates
* Install Google Chrome (optional, but makes your life easier)
* Install [Visual Studio 2013 Professional][win_visual_studio_link]
* Install all updates from microsoft update
* Install [GIT][win_git_link] and select the option to add GIT to path
* Install [Python 2.7][win_python_link] and add c:\python27 to path (manually)
* Install [7-ZIP][win_7zip_link] and add the installation to path (manually)
* Install [CMake][win_cmake_link] and add to path
* Install [GO][win_go_link] and add to path
* Download and install [2008 runtime extensions][win_2008_runtime_ext_link]

### Configuration

#### git

Repo will complain if git isn't properly configured. Setting name and
email should be sufficient, but you also may at least want to set the
two additional settings suggested:

    C:\> git config --global user.email trond.norbye@gmail.com
    C:\> git config --global user.name "Trond Norbye"
    C:\> git config --global color.ui false
    C:\> git config --global core.autocrlf true

### How to build

Before you may start to build on Microsoft Windows you have to set up
the environment. The script `environment.bat` is located in the `win32`
directory.

Open cmd.com and type in the following (assuming c:\compile\couchbase
is the directory holding your source):

    C:\> set source_root=c:\compile\couchbase
    C:\> set target_arch=amd64
    C:\> environment

You may now follow the build description outlined in [How to
build](#user-content-how-to-build). Please note that the make utility
on windows is named `nmake`.

## MacOSX

Multiple versions of Mac OSX may work, but this list is verified with
El Capitan

* Install XCode 7.2
* Install [Homebrew][homebrew_link]

Install the following packages from homebrew:

    trond@ok> brew install cmake git go ccache openssl repo

You should be all set to start compile the server as described above.

## Ubuntu 14.04

The steps below may work on other versions of Ubuntu as well, but this
procedure is verified with a clean installation of Ununtu 14.04.1

    sudo su -
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo
    chmod a+x repo
    mv repo /usr/local/bin
    apt-get install -y git gcc g++ ccache cmake libssl-dev libicu-dev \
                       erlang mercurial
    cd /usr/local
    hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go
    cd go/src
    ./all.bash
    cd ../../bin
    ln -s ../go/bin/go
    ln -s ../go/bin/gofmt

## Fedora 21

The steps below may work on other versions of Fedora as well, but this
procedure is verified with a clean installation of Fedora 21

    sudo su -
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo
    chmod a+x repo
    mv repo /usr/local/bin
    yum install -y gcc gcc-c++ git cmake ccache redhat-lsb-core \
                   erlang mercurial openssl-devel libicu-devel
    cd /usr/local
    hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go
    cd go/src
    ./all.bash
    cd ../../bin
    ln -s ../go/bin/go
    ln -s ../go/bin/gofmt

## OpenSUSE

I tested this on a clean install of OpenSUSE 13.2 by choosing the
defaults during the installer except choosing gnome desktop and enable
ssh access.

    sudo zypper install gcc gcc-c++ autoconf automake ncurses-devel \
                        git go ccache libopenssl-devel cmake

Open a new terminal to ensure you get an updated environment (the
package install modifies some of the environement variables)

    curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
    sudo mkdir /opt/couchbase
    sudo chown `whoami` /opt/couchbase
    mkdir -p compile/couchbase
    cd compile/couchbase
    repo init -u git://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m sherlock.xml -g default,build
    repo sync
    repo start opensuse --all
    mkdir cbdeps && cd cbdeps
    ../cbbuild/cbdeps/build-all-sherlock.sh
    export CB_DOWNLOAD_DEPS_CACHE=`pwd`/output
    export CB_DOWNLOAD_DEPS_MANIFEST=`pwd`/output/manifest.cmake
    unset GOBIN
    cd ..
    gmake PREFIX=/opt/couchbase

You should be able to start the server by running

    /opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-server start

## SmartOS

The following chapters describes how to configure and build under
various containers hosted by SmartOS. [Joyent][joyent_link] provides a
variety of datasets for various operating systems (CentOS, Fedora,
FreeBSD, Debian, SmartOS, ...). This section is not intended to cover
all of these, but covers a set of configurations known to work.

### SmartOS container

The following descrtiption use the standard64 (14.2.1) image imported by:

    root@smartos~> imgadm import 3f57ffe8-47da-11e4-aa8b-dfb50a06586a

The KVM may be created with the following attributes (store in `smartos.json`):

    {
      "alias" : "compilesrv",
      "autoboot": true,
      "brand": "joyent",
      "dns_domain" : "norbye.org",
      "resolvers" : [ "8.8.4.4" ],
      "image_uuid" : "3f57ffe8-47da-11e4-aa8b-dfb50a06586a",
      "hostname" : "compilesrv",
      "filesystems" : [
       {
          "type" : "lofs",
          "source" : "/zones/home",
          "target" : "/home",
          "options" : "nodevices"
        }
      ],
      "max_physical_memory": 4096,
      "nics": [
         {
          "nic_tag": "admin",
          "ip": "10.0.0.207",
          "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
          "gateway": "10.0.0.1"
        }
      ]
    }

Create the KVM with:

    root@smartos~> vmadm create -f smartos.json

Log into the newly created zone and install the following packages:

    root@compilesrv~> pkgin update
    root@compilesrv~> pkgin -y in py27-expat-2.7.7 icu-53.1 erlang-16.1.2nb3 go-1.3

[Install Google repo][google_repo_link] and you should be all set to
start building the code as described above.

### CentOS 7

The following descrtiption use the Centos-7 image imported by:

    root@smartos~> imgadm import 553da8ba-499e-11e4-8bee-5f8dadc234ce

The KVM may be created with the following attributes (store in `centos.json`):

    {
      "alias": "centos-7",
      "brand": "kvm",
      "resolvers": [
        "10.0.0.1",
        "8.8.4.4"
      ],
      "default-gateway": "10.0.0.1",
      "hostname":"centos",
      "ram": "6144",
      "vcpus": "2",
      "nics": [
        {
          "nic_tag": "admin",
          "ip": "10.0.0.201",
          "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
          "gateway": "10.0.0.1",
          "model": "virtio",
          "primary": true
        }
      ],
      "disks": [
        {
          "image_uuid": "553da8ba-499e-11e4-8bee-5f8dadc234ce",
          "boot": true,
          "model": "virtio",
          "image_size": 10240
        },
       {
          "model": "virtio",
          "size": 10240
        }
      ],
    "customer_metadata": {
        "root_authorized_keys": "<my ssh key>"
      }
    }

Create the KVM with:

    root@smartos~> vmadm create -f centos.json

You should now be able to ssh into the machine and run `yum update` and
install all of the updates ;-)

Install as much as possible of the precompiled dependencies with:

    yum install -y gcc gcc-c++ make redhat-lsb git openssl-devel

A newer version of cmake, go and repo is needed so we have to compile
it from source with:

    wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.2/cmake-3.2.1.tar.gz
    tar xfz cmake-3.2.1.tar.gz
    cd cmake-3.2.1
    ./bootstrap && make && make install
    cd /usr/local
    git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go
    cd go
    git checkout -b go1.4.2 go1.4.2
    cd src
    ./all.bash
    cd ../../bin
    ln -s ../go/bin/go
    ln -s ../go/bin/gofmt
    curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo
    chmod a+x repo

And you should be all set to start building the code as described above.

### Ubuntu

The following descrtiption use the Ubuntu 14.04 image imported by:

    root@smartos~> imgadm import c864f104-624c-43d2-835e-b49a39709b6b

The KVM may be created with the following attributes (store in `ubuntu.json`):

    {
      "alias": "ubuntu-1404",
      "brand": "kvm",
      "resolvers": [
        "10.0.0.1",
        "8.8.4.4"
      ],
      "default-gateway": "10.0.0.1",
      "hostname":"ubuntu",
      "ram": "6144",
      "vcpus": "2",
      "nics": [
        {
          "nic_tag": "admin",
          "ip": "10.0.0.203",
          "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
          "gateway": "10.0.0.1",
          "model": "virtio",
          "primary": true
        }
      ],
      "disks": [
        {
          "image_uuid": "c864f104-624c-43d2-835e-b49a39709b6b",
          "boot": true,
          "model": "virtio",
          "image_size": 10240
        },
       {
          "model": "virtio",
          "size": 20480
        }
      ],
    "customer_metadata": {
        "root_authorized_keys": "<my ssh key>"
      }
    }

Create the KVM with:

    root@smartos~> vmadm create -f ubuntu.json

You should now be able to ssh into the machine and run `aptitude` and
install all of the updates ;-)

Install as much as possible of the precompiled dependencies with:

    apt-get update --fix-missing
    apt-get install -y git gcc g++ make ccache lsb-release libssl-dev cmake

A newer version of go and repo is needed so we have to compile
it from source with:

    cd /usr/local
    git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go
    cd go
    git checkout -b go1.4.2 go1.4.2
    cd src
    ./all.bash
    cd ../../bin
    ln -s ../go/bin/go
    ln -s ../go/bin/gofmt
    curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo
    chmod a+x repo

And you should be all set to start building the code as described above.

### Debian7

    chmod a+x repo

And you should be all set to start building the code as described above.

## Static Analysis

There are pre-canned build rules to allow you to run the
[Clang Static Analyzer][clang_static_analyzer_link] against the Couchbase
codebase.

So far this has only been tested on OS X, using Clang shipping as part
of OS X Developer Tools. It *should* be possible to also run on other
platforms which Clang/LLVM is available, however this isn't tested.

### Prerequisites

* Install `clang` (from OS X Developer Tools). If you can build from source you should already have this :)
* Download and extract clang Static Analyzer tools
  (from [clang-analyzer.llvm.org][clang_static_analyzer_link]).
  Note that while the actual analyzer functionality is built into
  clang, this is needed for `scan-build` and `scan-view` tools to
  invoke and display the analyser results.

### Running

*  Add `scan-build` and `scan-view` to your path:

        export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/checker-276

*  Run `make analyzer` at the top-level to configure clang-analyser as the 'compiler':

        make analyzer

*  At the end you will see a message similar to the following - Invoke the specified command to browse the found bugs:


        scan-build: 31 bugs found.
        scan-build: Run 'scan-view /source/build-analyzer/analyser-results/2014-06-05-173247-52416-1' to examine bug reports.

## Thread Sanitizer

There are pre-canned build rules to allow you to build with [ThreadSanitizer][thread_sanitizer_link], to detect threading issues.

### Prerequities

* A compiler which supports ThreadSantizier. Recent version of Clang
  (3.2+) or GCC (4.8+) are claimed to work, however only Clang (3.5+) has
  been tested.

### Running

* Ensure that the compiler supporting ThreadSanitizer is chosen by
  CMake. If it's the system default compiler there is nothing to do;
  otherwise you will need to set both `CC` and `CXX` environment
  variables to point to the C / C++ compiler before calling the build
  system.

* Pass the variable `CB_THREADSANITIZER=1` to CMake.

One liner for a Ubuntu-based system where Clang isn't the default system compiler:

        CC=clang CXX=clang++ make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS="-D CB_THREADSANITIZER=1"

* Run one or more tests. Any issues will be reported (to stderr by default).

### Customizating ThreadSanitizer

See `cmake/Modules/CouchbaseThreadSanitizer.cmake` CMake fragment for
how ThreadSanizer is configured.

See the `TSAN_OPTIONS` environment variable (documented on the
ThreadSanitizer [Flags][thread_sanitizer_flags] wiki page) for more
information on configuring.

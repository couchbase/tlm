# tlm - "Top-level Makefile" for Couchbase Server

This repository contains a number of tools and scripts for building
Couchbase Server. The main interesting part is the top-level CMakeLists.txt,
which is the entry point for a complete Server build. There are also a number
of utility CMake libraries in cmake/Modules.

## Software requirements

* C/C++ compiler; one of:
  * gcc 13.2 or newer
  * Visual Studio 2022 or newer
  * Xcode
  * clang
* CMake 3.16 or newer
* Google repo (in order to fetch all of the source code)
* A build tool such as Make or Ninja
* ccache may speed up the development cycle when clang / gcc is used

Our production builds currently use gcc-13.2.0 on Linux platforms;
Visual Studio 2022 on Windows; and Xcode 15.2.0 on MacOS.

### Requirements on Windows

In addition to Visual Studio, gcc must be installed and on the PATH for
building some of the Go language tools. We use a recent version of MinGW for
this.

Couchbase uses Google repo to stitch together all of the individual git
repositories. Repo is implemented in python, but it's unfortunately using
features not available on python for windows. We use a modified version of
repo from http://github.com/esrlabs/git-repo.

It is important to set the git config option `core.longpaths` to `true`.

In general it is quite challenging to get a Windows box configured perfectly
for building Couchbase Server. If you are familiar with Ansible, it may be
useful to look at the Ansible scripts we use to configure our build VMs.
They are available here: https://github.com/couchbase/build-infra/tree/master/ansible/windows/couchbase-server/window2016

### Additional software requirements on unsupported platforms

Couchbase Server requires a great many libraries, computer languages, and
build tools to successfully build. The list in the previous section should
be all that is required to be installed prior to starting building, however.
The remaining packages are pre-built by Couchbase and downloaded as part of
the build on supported platforms.

Supported platforms include, at this time of writing:

* Windows (10, 2016, or newer)
* MacOS (10.12 or newer)
* Linux
  * Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04
  * Debian 8 or 9
  * SUSE 12 or 15
  * Centos 7 or 8
  * Amazon Linux 2

If you are building on another platform, you will need to also provide all
of the required tools and libraries. The canonical list of these packages
can be found in the file `tlm\deps\manifest.cmake`. For the most part, if
you install these tools and then ensure that `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` points to
their installation directories, CMake will pick them up as part of the
build. It is however beyond the scope of this document to cover exactly how
all of those tools must be built and installed for use in a Couchbase Server
build. We strongly recommend restricting building to supported platforms.

If you are building on a platform which is similar to a supported platform
but not exactly the same, you may be able to "lie" to the build about what
platform you are on and have it download the supported pre-built binaries for
a different platform. For instance, if you are building on Ubuntu 18.10,
it may work to tell the build system that you're actually on Ubuntu 18.04 and
have it download the required packages for you. To do this, set the CMake
variable `CB_DOWNLOAD_DEPS_PLATFORM` to one of the platform strings from
`manifest.cmake`, eg.

    cmake -D CB_DOWNLOAD_DEPS_PLATFORM=macosx .....

Note: On Linux systems, you may have to specify `;linux` as part of the
platform string, eg.

    cmake -D CB_DOWNLOAD_DEPS_PLATFORM="ubuntu18.04;linux" ....

Be sure to use quotes around that value to prevent the ; from being
interpreted by your shell.

## How to build

Couchbase utilizes [CMake][cmake_link] in order to provide build support for
a wide range of platforms. CMake isn't a build system like GNU Autotools,
but a tool that generates build information for external systems like:
Visual Studio projects, XCode projects and Makefiles to name a few. Internal
builds of Couchbase (and hence what we test) use Makefiles on Linux and
MacOS and Ninja on Windows. Other systems _may_ however work, but you're
pretty much on your own if you try to use them.

### Simple build (Linux and MacOS)

If you just want to build Couchbase and without any special
configuration, you may use the Makefile we've supplied for your
convenience:

    trond@ok > mkdir source
    trond@ok > cd source
    trond@ok source> repo init -u https://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m branch-master.xml
    trond@ok source> repo sync
    trond@ok source> make

This would install the build software in a subdirectory named
`install`. To change this you may run:

    trond@ok source> make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS='-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/couchbase'

If you want to build the Enterprise Edition (requires access to
git repositories containing closed source) you need to tell repo
to fetch additional source by adding `-g enterprise,default` to
repo init:

    trond@ok source> repo init -u https://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m branch-master.xml -g enterprise,default

### Simple build (Windows)

The build is not optimized for Windows, but the following steps should work. Start with the
same "repo init" and "repo sync" steps as above, then run:

    tlm\win32\environment.bat
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=cl -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=cl -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
    ninja install

### Specifying what to build

The default make target if not explicilty specified is `all` - this builds all
binaries required for the shipping product. This is sufficient to run Couchbase
Server itself, but doesn't include unit test / benchmark binaries etc.

The following additional targets are available:

* `everything` : Builds both production binaries, along with unit tests, benchmarks etc for
all subprojects.
* `<PROJECT>_everything`
: Builds all binaries for the specific project, e.g `platform_everything`.
(Similar to `make -C <PROJECT> all`, but also builds non-shipping binaries)
* `install`
: Standard CMake target; builds all production binaries and installs them to
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

### cbbackupmgr, cbimport and cbexport

Please note that the Community Edition packages on couchbase.com contain `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport` and `cbexport`.
They will not be built when compiling from source as the source code is private. As well as not having these
programs the sample buckets cannot be loaded as it uses `cbimport`. To workaround this issue `cbbackupmgr`,
`cbimport` and `cbexport` can be copied from the Community Edition binaries.

**End of the basic build information**

The remainder of this document covers certain special cases for building
Couchbase Server. You likely will not be interested in anything beyond this
point unless you work for Couchbase and have specific development issues to
work on.

### "Best" Developer build

If you're building Couchbase Server more than just a one-off, there are
a few modifications you can make to speed up your compile-edit-debug cycle.
The most significant two are:

1. Use Ninja as the CMake generator - [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) is
"a small build system which focuses on speed". It's main advantages over the
default generator (GNU Make) are:
   1. Automatic parallelism based on machine CPUs, and better CPU utilisation.
   2. Much faster to determine "what's changed" for incremental builds -
   Ninja takes less than 1 second to figure out what source files have changed
   in a complete server build; GNU Make is closer to 10s.
   3. Allows for limiting the number of parallel link jobs. Due to the fact
   that we're using static linking each link process may require a lot of
   memory (I've seen them exceed 2GB resident memory). Pass
   `-D CB_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=4` to `cmake` to limit the number of parallel
   link jobs to 4
2. Use a non-optimised (Debug) build. This is around 2x faster to compile,
   and also improves debuggability over the default _RelWithDebInfo_ build
   type. Note it does produce slower code, so this isn't suitable if you're
   doing any performance measuremnts.

#### Prerequisites

Ninja is available in most Linux distos now, and via homebrew on macOS:

macOS:
```commandline
brew install ninja
```
Debian / Ubuntu:
```commandline
apt install ninja-build
```

Once you have Ninja available, configure your build tree to use it and enable
Debug build type:

```commandline
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja -D CB_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=4 -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

Then use `ninja` instead of your normal command - for example to build and
install everything run (from `build/` dir):
```commandline
ninja install
```

That will compile and install everything, automatically selecting a suitable
compile parallelism based on CPU core count.

#### Tips

* You _cannot_ change a CMake generator once a tree is configured; so if you've
already configured a given build tree you'll need to remove `build/` and re-run
CMake with the above args.

* Ninja can build specific targets just like GNU Make, simply specify the name
of the target as you would with make:
```commandline
ninja memcached
```

* Ninja can also build only a single project of the tree (like GNU Make),
however the syntax is a bit different - instead of changing into the
subdirectory and running `make`, you _always_ run Ninja from the toplevel
build dir, but specify `<project>/all` as the target - for example:
```commandline
ninja kv_engine/all
```

* Similary to just compile and install a single project specify
`<project>/install` as the target to build:
```commandline
ninja couchstore/install
```

* You only have to explicitly run CMake (`cmake -G Ninja ...`) the first time a
  build directory is setup, after then you just need to invoke `ninja` to build
  whatever has changed. This includes both local changes and if you pull new
  code from git. Ninja will automagically invoke CMake if necessary
  (for example if source files have been added / removed).

### Customize your builds

CMake offers a wide range of customizations, and this chapter won't
try to cover all of them. There is plenty of documentation available
on the [webpage](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html).

There is no point of trying to keep a list of all tunables in this
document. To find the tunables you have two options: look in
`cmake/Modules/*.cmake` or you may look in the cache file generated
during a normal build (see `build/CMakeCache.txt`)

There are two ways to customize your own builds. You can do it all by
yourself by invoking cmake yourself:

    trond@ok > mkdir source
    trond@ok > mkdir build
    trond@ok > cd source
    trond@ok source> repo init -u https://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m branch-master.xml
    trond@ok source> repo sync
    trond@ok source> cd ../build
    trond@ok build> cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/couchbase -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D DTRACE_FOUND:BOOL=True -D DTRACE:FILEPATH=/usr/sbin/dtrace CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/r14b04;/opt/couchbase"
    trond@ok build> gmake all install

Or pass extra options to the convenience Makefile provided:

    trond@ok > mkdir source
    trond@ok > mkdir build
    trond@ok > cd source
    trond@ok source> repo init -u https://github.com/couchbase/manifest -m branch-master.xml
    trond@ok source> repo sync
    trond@ok source> make PREFIX=/opt/couchbase CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/r14b04;/opt/couchbase" EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS='-D DTRACE_FOUND:BOOL=True -D DTRACE:FILEPATH=/usr/sbin/dtrace'

Use `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to specify a "list" of directories to search
for tools/libraries if they are stored in "non-standard"
locations. Ex:

    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/r14b04;/opt/couchbase;/opt/local"

## Static Analysis

There are pre-canned build rules to allow you to run the
[Clang Static Analyzer][clang_static_analyzer_link] against the Couchbase
codebase.

So far this has only been tested on OS X, using Clang shipping as part
of OS X Developer Tools. It *should* be possible to also run on other
platforms which Clang/LLVM is available, however this isn't tested.

### Prerequisites

* Install `clang` (from OS X Developer Tools). If you can build from source
  you should already have this :)
* Download and extract clang Static Analyzer tools
  (from [clang-analyzer.llvm.org][clang_static_analyzer_link]).
  Note that while the actual analyzer functionality is built into
  clang, this is needed for `scan-build` and `scan-view` tools to
  invoke and display the analyser results.

### Running

*  Add `scan-build` and `scan-view` to your path:

        export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/scan-build

*  Run `make analyze` at the top-level to configure clang-analyser as the
   'compiler':

        make analyze

*  At the end you will see a message similar to the following - Invoke the
   specified command to browse the found bugs:

        scan-build: 31 bugs found.
        scan-build: Run 'scan-view /source/build-analyzer/analyser-results/2014-06-05-173247-52416-1' to examine bug reports.

## Address / Thread / UndefinedBehavior Sanitizers

There are pre-canned build rules to allow you to build with
[ThreadSanitizer][thread_sanitizer_link] to detect threading issues,
[AddressSanitizer][address_sanitizer_link] to detect memory errors, or
[UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer][undefined_sanitizer_link] to detect
undefined behavior.

### Prerequities

* A compiler which supports Address / Thread / UndefinedBehavior
  Sanitizer. Recent version of Clang (3.2+) or GCC (4.8+) are claimed
  to work. Currently automatied tests use GCC 7 / Clang 3.9.

### Running

* Ensure that the compiler supporting *Sanitizer is chosen by
  CMake. If it's the system default compiler there is nothing to do;
  otherwise you will need to set both `CC` and `CXX` environment
  variables to point to the C / C++ compiler before calling the build
  system.

* Pass the variable `CB_THREADSANITIZER=1` / `CB_ADDRESSSANITIZER=1` /
  `CB_UNDEFINEDSANITIZER=1` to CMake.

ThreadSanitizer one liner for a Ubuntu-based system where Clang isn't
the default system compiler:

        CC=clang CXX=clang++ make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS="-D CB_THREADSANITIZER=1"

and for AddressSanitizer:

        CC=clang CXX=clang++ make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS="-D CB_ADDRESSSANITIZER=1"

similary for UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer:

        CC=clang CXX=clang++ make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS="-D CB_UNDEFINEDSANITIZER=1"

* Run one or more tests. Any issues will be reported (to stderr by default).

### Customizing Address / Thread / UndefinedBehavior Sanitizer

See `cmake/Modules/CouchbaseThreadSanitizer.cmake` CMake fragment for
how ThreadSanizer is configured.

See the `TSAN_OPTIONS` environment variable (documented on the
ThreadSanitizer [Flags][thread_sanitizer_flags] wiki page) for more
information on configuring.

Similarly for AddressSanitizer / UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer see
`cmake/Modules/CouchbaseAddressSanitizer.cmake` or
`cmake/Modules/CouchbassUndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.cmake`, and the
`ASAN_OPTIONS` / `UBSAN_OPTIONS` environment variable (documented on
the AddressSanitizer [Flags][address_sanitizer_flags] wiki page) for
details..
